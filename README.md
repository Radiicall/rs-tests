# rs-tests
My first Rust project

## The Tests
This repo has 2 tests


1. Rock Paper Scissors CLI `-r / --rps`
2. Shopping List CLI `-s / --shoppinglist`

I made these so I could learn how to use Rust.

You can try out the code for yourself by downloading cargo and building the project

## Build Instructions
Clone the project

Run: 

```
cargo build -r 
cd target/release/
```

After these two commands run the program using

`./tests -h` or `./tests.exe -h`
