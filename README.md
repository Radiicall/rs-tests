# rs-tests
My first Rust project

## The Tests
This repo has 2 tests

<ol>
  <li>Rock Paper Scissors CLI `-r / --rps`</li>
  <li>Shopping List CLI `-s / --shoppinglist`</li>
</ol>

I made these so I could learn how to use Rust.

You can try out the code for yourself by downloading cargo and building the project

## Build Instructions
Clone the project

Run: 

```
cargo build -r 
cd target/release/
```

After these two commands run the program using

`./tests -h` or `./tests.exe -h`
